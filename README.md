# TornadoWallet

A Python/HTML Wallet based upon the Tornado framework.

> **EXTREME WIP** Lots of work, ongoing, to be considered immature until further notice.

# Proof of concept

Not functional for now, merely a technology test.

mockup "index" and "transactions" screens only are up, with made up data.

Goal is to re-use the existing python code for behind the scene heavy lifting, but leverage HTML/JS flexibility for GUI.

# Installation

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

An autoinstaller will be provided with first beta version.
